    <h3 class="muchoTexto">Introduction</h3>
        <p class="muchoTexto">
          <b>Cactus Guy</b> is a platformer video game that I began back on the hot summer of July 2023, after playing the game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2231450/Pizza_Tower/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pizza Tower</a>
          I thought about making my own platformer, as a letter of love to the genre and video games in general. My initial plans for the game were that it would have 4 levels, a simple platformer
          to learn to code, and being a solo-dev in general. I have 10 builds of the game archived in my hard drive, but in February 2024, I decided to put it on-hold in favor of finishing
          <a href="vsAit.html">VS Aitornado</a>, as it would become 4 years old and there was little to no progress.

          <p class="muchoTexto">My plans for Cactus Guy were kinda mixed, I thought about just totally cancel the game, or continue it later.
            But my decision, is to make it better, in the future. I'm gonna make a table with the original ideas of the game, and next to it, my
            future plans. To make it bigger, better and faster (well maybe not faster I just wanted to say it because of Daft Punk's song).

            Overall, I really enjoyed working on the game. And hey, maybe I begin the development after we finish VS Aitornado, and in the
            mean time I plan my next big project with Dani and Izan<b>;]</b>
