    <h3 class="muchoTexto">El Pollastre</h3>
        <p class="muchoTexto">
        Here we are, with my most obscure game ever. <b>El Pollastre.</b>
        <br>
        <br>
        A little bit of context. 
        <br>
        <br>
        So I had this one friend, which I will call ElPoyo (like Pollo, chicken is Spanish,
        but badly wroten) and I had some fights with him like 5 or 6 months earlier, the thing is, that I wanted to become friends again, but he didn't. So I thought "maybe if I make
        a videogame for him, he will forgive me!" little did I know that it was going to be USELESS.

        <h1 class="muchoTexto">Screenshots from the only level and build existing of the game, dated on June 2023.</h1>
        <p class="muchoTexto">There's not a lot to say about this game, as it was in a very early state when I stopped it. I was going to publish it with 5 levels.
          <br>
          <b>Mountain, Desert, City, Gym, and the ending, The Cave.</b> 
          <br>
          Where El Pollastre would've had to save his girlfriend, La Polla.
          <br>
          Apart from the first level, the only thing I have is the second level background, which was later repurposed as the main background for <a href="cactusGuy.html">Cactus Guy</a>.
